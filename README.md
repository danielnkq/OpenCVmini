Project description:<br>We found an example https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/samples/python/squares.py
,which is a OpenCV program to detect square. To modify it, we decided to make it detect triangle and rectangle instead.


You will need to install cv2 module in python in order to run this script. 
download opencv module file from http://opencv.org/
run " pip install opecv-contrib-python" in your terminal window
