Project description:<br>We found an example https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/samples/python/squares.py
,which is a OpenCV program to detect square. To modify it, we decided to make it detect triangle and rectangle instead.

Instrution:<br>The foundation of the project is to install OpenCV to computers. Due to the differences of operation systems, the installation process is different.<br>This is the OpenCV-python package link:https://pypi.python.org/pypi/opencv-contrib-python.
